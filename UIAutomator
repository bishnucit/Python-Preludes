UIAutomator is a tool to perform UI automation Testing for Android devices.
Here we will use UIAutomator ported for Python.

Prerequisites
1. Python 2.7/ Python 3.4
2. Internet connection
3. Python bin is present in OS path.
4. Android SDK installed and proper path is set.
5. Device drivers installed properly for Device under Test.(adb devices should show the device you want to automate)

Note: 4.1 OS devices will have some functions not working. like d.screenshot('location') will only work for 4.2 and above.

Steps:
1. Open cmd prompt and type 
pip install urllib3

2. After it gets installed type
pip install uiautomator

And we are ready for testing Android Apps through python and uiautomator

Open command prompt and check the device is detected or not - 
adb devices (copy the device id)

now open python in interactive mode by typing Python in cmd prompt.

>>> from uiautomator import Device
>>> d = Device('DEVICE_ID')
>>> d.press.home()  # observe home key is pressed in device.

Now we can start writing test scripts for automation in Android device.
